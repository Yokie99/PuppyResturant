Navbar & footer, menu page: Kyle
catering & photos: Xavier
Home & About: Leo
Isaiah Critique of main branch: 
8:35 A.M.

-About page-
photo does not line up with the div that is to the right of it.
Our Team banner is too thin add some margin top above "Our Team" Text
No rounded edges for any of the cards. 
Card text needs less leading space.
footer img "A Spaniel Company" needs to be space a bit more above the phone number.

-Catering-
Second image / catering serves text should probably be in a row with 2 cols to get it more accurate to the prototype.

-Navbar-
Inconsistent on most pages.

-Photo-

Needs a more work.

    -Tablet:
        -Menu Page: I noticed a missing margin spacing between the dessert menu and grill menu.
        -Catering Page:Looks like you are having trouble with resizing images here
    -Mobile:
        -Home Page: The header image could probably look better if it was zoomed out (not critical)
        -Menu Page: The Menu Accordian was an awesome idea and I like it a lot!!
        -Catering Page: Obviously has similiar responsiveness issues as in tablet
